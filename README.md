# hiccup
A hybrid functional programming language I'm designing for fun. Originally started as an exercise in learning Haskell while also practicing writing a parser by hand.

Currently includes a lexer, a recursive-descent parser, and an interpreter. Eventually a compiler will also be included for the language, and if I decide to keep pursuing it, I may switch to a parser generator to support a more complex language grammar.
